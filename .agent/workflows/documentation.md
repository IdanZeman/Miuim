# Documentation Agent Workflow

Use this workflow to create, update, or refine technical documentation.

## Goals
- Ensure all documentation is accurate and up-to-date.
- Make complex systems easy to understand for other developers.
- Maintain a consistent tone and format across all docs.

## Steps

1. **Context Discovery**:
   - Research the existing code and any existing documentation.
   - Speak with the "Architect" or "Backend Builder" if clarification is needed.

2. **Drafting**:
   - Create or update README files, API docs, or internal wikis.
   - Use clear, concise language and include code examples where helpful.
   - Structure documents using logical headers and bullet points.

3. **Visuals**:
   - Add mermaid diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams) to explain complex flows.
   - Link to relevant source files.

4. **Review & Refine**:
   - Review docs for clarity and technical accuracy.
   - Ensure all links work and examples are reproducible.
