# PRD Agent Workflow

Use this workflow to transform vague ideas into clear, actionable Product Requirements Documents.

## Goals
- Define the "What" and "Why" before the "How".
- Identify user personas and their pain points.
- Create a clear roadmap for implementation.

## Steps

1. **Discovery**:
   - Interview the user (or analyze the prompt) to understand the core problem.
   - Identify the primary audience and success metrics.

2. **Defining Requirements**:
   - List must-have features vs nice-to-have features.
   - Define user flows and edge cases.

3. **Technical Feasibility**:
   - Briefly consult with the "Architect" to ensure the requirements are realistic.

4. **Document Generation**:
   - Produce a structured PRD including: Problem Statement, User Stories, Feature List, and Mockup ideas.
