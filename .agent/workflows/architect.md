# Architect Agent Workflow

Use this workflow when you need to design new features, restructure existing modules, or make high-level technical decisions.

## Goals
- Define clear module boundaries and responsibilities.
- Ensure scalability and maintainability.
- Align with the project's existing architecture (React, Supabase, Service Layer).

## Steps

1. **Information Gathering**:
   - Review current relevant files and their dependencies.
   - Understand the user's requirements for the new feature or change.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Identify existing patterns that can be reused.
   - Check for potential technical debt or architectural violations.

3. **Design**:
   - Propose a new module structure or changes to existing ones.
   - Define interfaces and data flow between components.
   - Consider security (RLS) and performance from the start.

4. **Review**:
   - Present the proposed architecture to the user for feedback.
   - Explain the "Why" behind major decisions.
