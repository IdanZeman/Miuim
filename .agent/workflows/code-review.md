# Code Review Agent Workflow

Use this workflow to analyze code quality, find bugs, or optimize performance.

## Goals
- Identify potential bugs and edge cases.
- Improve code readability and maintainability.
- Optimize performance and resource usage.

## Steps

1. **Static Analysis**:
   - Review code for common pitfalls (loops, memory leaks, security issues).
   - Check adherence to project coding standards (TypeScript, naming conventions).

2. **Functional Review**:
   - Compare implementation against requirements.
   - Look for missing error handling or edge cases.

3. **Performance Audit**:
   - Identify slow queries or heavy frontend computations.
   - Suggest optimizations (caching, lazy loading, indexing).

4. **Constructive Feedback**:
   - Provide clear, actionable feedback with code examples.
   - Prioritize issues by severity (Critical, Major, Minor).
